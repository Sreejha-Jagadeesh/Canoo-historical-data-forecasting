Demand Forecasting with ARIMA
Overview
This project utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for demand forecasting. The ARIMA model is a statistical method designed for time series forecasting, making it suitable for predicting future demand patterns based on historical data.

Key Features
ARIMA Model: Leveraging autoregression, differencing, and moving averages to capture time-dependent patterns.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): A quantitative measure of model performance, with a calculated MSE of 0.0512 indicating high accuracy.

Requirements
-pandas==1.3.3
-numpy==1.21.2
-matplotlib==3.4.3
-statsmodels==0.12.2
-scikit-learn==0.24.2

Usage
-dataset in the data/ directory.
-Run the ARIMA model script
-View results and visualizations in the document/ directory.

Results and Visualizations
The project generates visualizations illustrating the training data, actual demand, and ARIMA forecast.
MSE is calculated, and a low value of 0.0512 indicates accurate demand predictions.
